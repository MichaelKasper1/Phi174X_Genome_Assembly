# Phi174X_Genome_Assembly
This is the capstone project for the data structures and algorithms course I took. The aim project is to recreate the genome of a specific E Coli outbreak from Germany. My goals from the project were to implement knowledge of algorithms and to continue building my understanding of working with large genetic datasets.
